# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); see `COMPATIBILITY.md` for what counts as public API.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-05

Fixes from running the installed plugin on an unfamiliar repository (a large Meteor and React
application with GitLab CI).

### Fixed

- Default protected paths cover the CI definitions of every system the delivery adapter
  parses (GitLab, CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, Jenkins, Buildkite, Bitbucket) and git hook
  directories, not only GitHub workflows.
- `init` proposes `lint` and `typecheck` from an ESLint config or `tsconfig.json` plus the
  dependency when there is no script (linting that runs through husky or lint-staged), and
  notes missing `node_modules` and commands whose executable cannot be found.
- Deploy targets inferred from CI job names ignore emoji and punctuation, and stage words
  such as `review` and `test`; `🚀 deploy` no longer becomes a deployable named `🚀`.
- History reads at least `decomposition.history_min_commits` (default 1,000) recent commits
  when `history_days` holds fewer, so quiet repositories still yield co-change evidence; the
  map reports when the window was extended.

### Added

- `unknot graph hubs` and the `graph_hubs` MCP tool rank modules by fan-in and fan-out; the
  cartographer uses them instead of piping JSON into an interpreter, which policy denies.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

Initial release.

### Added

- Plugin runtime with the safety kernel: state machine, capability model, path and command
  broker, worktree isolation, event and evidence ledger, hook enforcement.
- Repository mapper with language, database, infrastructure, delivery and ownership adapters,
  and a generic multi-language adapter.
- Diagnosis with local and module detectors, ranked findings and pattern cards.
- Slice lifecycle: planning, approval gates, worktree-confined apply, verification engine,
  attestations, proof bundles and rollback.
- Opt-in OpenTelemetry-compatible telemetry (file or allowlisted OTLP exporter) with a content
  allowlist; off by default.
- Release pipeline: reproducible tarball, `SHA256SUMS`, CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM and Sigstore
  provenance attestations; published benchmark fixtures and harness.

### Migration notes

Initial release; there is nothing to migrate.

### Security

No advisories.
